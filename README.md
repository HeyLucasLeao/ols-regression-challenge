# OLS Regression Challenge

This project is an OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) regression challenge focused on predicting the mortality rate in counties across the United States. The goal is to build and evaluate regression models that can accurately estimate mortality rates based on various county-level features.

## Project Objectives

- Explore and preprocess county-level data from the United States.
- Develop OLS regression models to predict mortality rates.
- Analyze model performance and interpret results.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Follow the instructions in the code and notebooks to reproduce the analysis.
